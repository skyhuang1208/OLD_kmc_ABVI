1. General functions
	there are some functions for the whole program in "kmc_system.h", e.g., ran_generator, pbc, error
2. states array in functions
	if named "*states_#$%^&*": means this pointer won't change the position, i.e., array elements will be *(states_#$%^&* + i_iteration)
	if named "ptr_states":	   means this pointer will change the position, i.e., array elements will be *ptr_states and *ptr_states ++
3. array passing can be difficult
	1-d: 
		call:    func(array)
		declare: func(int array[]) or func(int *array)
		use:     array[i]
	2-d:
		call:    func(array)
		declare: func(int array[][3]) or int (*array)[3]
		use:     array[i][j] or (*(array+i))[j]
	3-d:
		call:    func(&array[0][0][0])
		declare: func(int *array)
		use:     *(array+i*ny*nz+j*nz+k)
4. energy diffs are calculated locally:
	1. choose a vacancy
	2. get all the 1st neighbor positions
	3. get all the 2nd neighbor positions of the 1st neighbor positions of the vacancy
	4. get the boundaries of all the above positions, i.e., if(x<xlo) xlo= x; if(x>xhi) xhi=x;
	5. only calculate energies within the ranges; the boundaries have to calculate again when loop to a new vacancy
5. store only the change of state information (history.info)
